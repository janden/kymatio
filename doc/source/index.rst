Kymatio is a Python module for computing wavelet and scattering transforms.

It is built on top of PyTorch, but also has a fast CUDA backend via cupy and
skcuda.

Use kymatio if you need a library that:

* integrates wavelet scattering in a deep learning architecture,
* supports 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D scattering transforms
* differentiable transforms for applications in generative modeling, reconstruction and more!
* runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU hardware.

A brief intro to wavelet scattering is provided in :ref:`user-guide`. For a
list of publications see
`Publications <https://www.di.ens.fr/data/publications>`_.

We wish to thank the Scientific Computing Core at the Flatiron Institute for the use of their computing resources for testing.

We would also like to thank École Normale Supérieure for their support.
